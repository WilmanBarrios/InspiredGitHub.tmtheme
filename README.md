# Inspired GitHub Color Scheme

Inspired GitHub is a color scheme for Sublime Text 3. It is, obviously, heavily inspired by the syntax highlighting found on GitHub. For readability, I've slightly cut down on the amount of color in the highlighting and I've introduced bolding for certain things, such as keywords.

## Custom Language Styles

While this color scheme will work with any language that your Sublime Text installation supports, I've specifically tested and made adjustments for the following languages and features:

- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON (highlighting up to 20 levels deep)
- Markdown
- Python
- PHP
- Sass/SCSS
- Find-in-Files
- [FileDiffs](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FileDiffs)
- [GitGutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter)
